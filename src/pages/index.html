    <p>As a small business owner myself, I understand your situation. <strong>You want to see a return on your investment</strong>. It is difficult to know who you can trust. There are those guys shouting at you from India. Websites for pennies on the dollar. And your mom who tells you maybe you should just use Wix. Sure, why not?</p>
    
    <p>The problem is that <strong>your business is unique</strong>. You are beyond the template. You know that. You want something that will improve your image online, but you are concerned that it won't work better than your own site. You know <strong>you need something better, but you aren't quite sure about all the moving parts</strong>.</p>

    <p>You don't need a new site. What you need is a sales and marketing funnel that allows you to expand your business online. The benefits of a strong web presence is a) 24/7 availability b) trust building c) educating your customers and d) making sure they can reach out at the exact right time in the sale.</p>
    <p>If done wrong, the above is useless. Today's customers are savvy and they can spot a fake, a $29 WordPress template, or just get plain frustrated and leave... never to return. Your job should be to capture the interest of your silent customers and drive them in a direction that has a direct and concrete benefit to your business.</p>

    <p>This is a day of action, mostly on my end. I will literally build your site, write your copy, get everything ready in one day. It does not have to be an all day meeting, however it would be useful if you are highly available. This might mean taking some phone calls, giving some feedback on designs, maybe jumping on an impromptu zoom / phone session to work in tandem.</p>

    <p>In general, step 2 shouldn't be that disruptive to a normal work day, but depending on how involved you want to be in the process, having the ability to step out on a call would be ideal. If this is difficult for you to do on a weekday, optionally we can do Step 2 on a Saturday.</p>

<div class="row align-center">
  <div class="column medium-6">

    <p>At the start of the project <strong>we had an out of date website that suddenly went down. We needed help quick</strong>. We were thinking to just do something a bit more modern and mobile friendly. Since the revamp <strong>we have had an increased number of inbound sales leads via the online contact form that James suggested</strong> verses just having an email link and phone number alone.</p>

    <p>As a small business owner, <strong>I always knew my website was an important part of driving new business</strong>. I am not a design expert, but James was able to go through many different sites and reduce it down to a core set of attributes that represented the business. Together, we redesigned the site and <strong>I feel more confident in the value that I am bringing to my customers and how I present that value online</strong>.</p>

    <p>At the start of the project I knew that I needed to do a revamp to make the site mobile friendly. James was able to come in, ask key questions, and get to know how I operated my business. Not only did the site look great on a mobile phone, but it streamlined several processes for both my clients and my staff.</p>
