<h3>Wesley Hemphill, Vice President</h3>
<p>Lane Mountain Mining DBA Hemphill Brothers Inc.</p>

<blockquote>At the start of the project we had an out of date website that suddenly went down. We needed help quick. We were thinking to just do something a bit more modern and mobile friendly. James was to look through some photographs of the mine, ask us some key questions about how the business operated, and approach the site in a way that improved our business goals. He did this while not going over the top design wise. I was afraid he might just create a site that was pretty, but not functional. Since the revamp we have had an increased number of inbound sales leads via the online contact form that James suggested verses just having an email link and phone number alone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a small business owner, I always knew my website was an important part of that puzzle. I knew that even though I didn't have high traffic, that it could be an important part of driving new business. I was able to sit down with James and talk extensively about my 15 years experience in my business, working with my clients, and what was working and what was not. James was able to take all of that information and develop a strategic plan of how to make the site work better for my business. One of the things I wanted to do was to stand out from my competition. I am not a design expert, but James was able to go through many different sites and reduce it down to a core set of attributes that I thought represented the business well. With this mood board in place, we were able to redesign the site and I now feel more confident in the value that I am bringing to my customers and how I present that value online.</blockquote>
