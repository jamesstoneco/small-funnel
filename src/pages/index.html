    <p>You already know the <strong>importance of being visible, searchable and findable online</strong>. The problem is that <strong>your firm is unique</strong>. You are way beyond the template. You want something that will improve your image online. Who knows <strong>will it outperform your outdated site</strong>? You can hire a designer, you can hire a programmer, you can hire a copywriter. But it all comes down to time.</p>

    <p><strong>You need a site that you can be proud of</strong>. One that requires only a minimal amount of your time (as few as 90-minutes), and <strong>will last for years to come</strong>. And one that can be done, well, yesterday.</p>


    <p>Small Funnel is a service dedicated that turns ho-hum and DIY consultant graveyards into <strong>beautiful, to the point, and easy to maintain</strong> online systems. While you sleep these sites will continue to <strong>build confidence</strong> like your living-in-the-machine-clone, <strong>educate like a master showman</strong>, but most importantly create a lead generation funnel that will help propel your business.</p>

      <p>You don't need a new site. What you need is a sales and marketing funnel that allows you to expand your business online. The benefits of a strong web presence is a) 24/7 availability b) trust building c) educating your customers and d) making sure they can reach out at the exact right time in the sale.</p>
      <p>If done wrong, the above is useless. Today's customers are savvy and they can spot a fake, a $29 WordPress template, or just get plain frustrated and leave... never to return. Your job should be to capture the interest of your silent customers and drive them in a direction that has a direct and concrete benefit to your business.</p>

      <p>This is a day of action, mostly on my end. I will literally build your site, write your copy, get everything ready in one day. It does not have to be an all day meeting, however it would be useful if you are highly available. This might mean taking some phone calls, giving some feedback on designs, maybe jumping on an impromptu zoom / phone session to work in tandem.</p>

    <div class="column medium-6">
      <p><strong>It's hard to stand out</strong> in the sea of other contractors and consultants. In person is one thing, but doing it online is a whole another set of obstacles. <strong>I knew that I needed someone I'd trust, who could understand my dilemma</strong>, where I was at, and where I wanted to go, and take care of all that translation to the web. James was exactly that person for me and <strong>he was able to create one unifying message in a process that was completely hands-off</strong>.</p>

      <p>As a small business owner, <strong>I always knew my website was an important part of driving new business</strong>. I am not a design expert, but James was able to go through many different sites and reduce it down to a core set of attributes that represented the business. Together, we redesigned the site and <strong>I feel more confident in the value that I am bringing to my customers and how I present that value online</strong>.</p>
